<h1>React Tic Tac Toe App</h1>

In this project, I built a Tic Tac Toe game using React. Also include a 10 seconds timer for each move and a move history that shows all the moves made during the game. The game will have one mode - multiplayer mode against another player.

Features:
- User can play Tic Tac Toe against another player.
- If user don't make move while timer is going - he is lose.
- User can see the move history for the current game.
- User can see that player move next or win and lose.

Functionality:

- Board: The game board is a 3x3 grid of squares. When a square is clicked, a move is made on that square. The board is updated to reflect the new move.
- Timer: A timer is displayed for each move made by the player. The timer starts when the player must click on a square, and stops when the move is made.
- Move History: A move history is displayed for the current game. The move history shows all the moves made by both players during the game. The move history is updated after each move.
- In multiplayer mode, two players can play against each other on the same device. The players take turns making moves on the board.
- Win Condition: The game ends when a player wins or there is a tie. The winner is displayed on the screen.
